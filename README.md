# WhatsApp Chatbot with Flask and Twilio

This project is a Flask-based WhatsApp chatbot that uses the Twilio API to send and receive WhatsApp messages. It can be extended to include AI-based responses or any custom logic.

---

## Features

- Receive WhatsApp messages via Twilio webhook  
- Respond with dynamic replies using Flask  
- Easily extendable to integrate AI models (e.g., LangChain, OpenAI)  
- Local development with public URL exposure via ngrok  

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Twilio account with WhatsApp Sandbox enabled  
- Ngrok (or any tunneling service)  
- Required Python packages (listed below)  

---

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Create a Twilio Account

- Go to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and sign up for a free account.  
- Complete account verification by adding your phone number.
---
### 2. Enable WhatsApp Sandbox in Twilio

- In Twilio Console, navigate to **Messaging > Try it Out > WhatsApp Sandbox**.  
- Note the sandbox WhatsApp number (e.g., `+14155238886`).  
- Send the provided join code via WhatsApp **from your phone** to the sandbox number to join. Example:  
  Send **join awesome-squid** to the number.

### 3. Clone the Project Repository


git clone https:[https://github.com/harshrathod0585/Chatbot-Whatsapp-Integrated]
cd whatsapp-flask-chatbot

---

### 4. Install Ngrok


npm install -g ngrok

---
### 5. Run Flask Server and Ngrok Tunnel

* Run your Flask app in one terminal:


flask run


* In another terminal, start ngrok to expose your local server (assuming Flask runs on port 5000):


ngrok http 5000


* Copy the forwarding URL from ngrok (e.g., `[https://abcd1234](https://6817-2409-40c1-210b-25be-bc6c-a9a1-b527-ebc2.ngrok-free.app)`).

  ---

### 6. Configure Twilio Sandbox Webhook

* In the Twilio Console WhatsApp Sandbox settings, set the **WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN** webhook to:

{your-ngrok-url}/whatsapp


> **Note:**
>
> * Ngrok URLs change every time you restart it, so you need to update the webhook URL in the Twilio Sandbox accordingly.
> * After restarting ngrok, you might need to resend the join code from WhatsApp to rejoin the sandbox.

## Python Dependencies

Install required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Or manually:

pip install flask twilio

---

## Extend the Chatbot

You can customize the `/whatsapp` Flask route to add your own logic or integrate AI-powered responses (using LangChain, OpenAI, or other models).
